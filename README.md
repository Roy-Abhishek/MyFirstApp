# MyFirstApp
This is the first web application that I made which I uploaded to the Internet in November of 2020.
The website has been taken down due to lack of activity by Heroku, where I hosted the website.

I had recently learned about APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and how to use them which led to me making this application as my main API-based project. The app is essentially a URL shortener which uses the Tiny URL API to shorten user inputted URLs. What makes this app special however, is the second webpage labeled "Bored?" This page is basically a place where users who are bored can come to entertain themselves. It offers a variety of entertainments from jokes of mutiple genres, to fun facts and pictures about dogs and cats, to even the picture of the day taken by the Hubble Telescope (from a NASA API).

All together, this project used a total of 8 APIs and I consider it as my first big success in my coding journey. Looking at the code itself, you can also see how much of a beginner I was. I had only been coding for 5 months up to that point so my algorithms and variable names could use a lot of improvement. I think this code represents how far I got in just 5 months and how far I have come since then. Looking at my newer projects, like NoughtsAndCrosses (Tic Tac Toe) and its AI version, you can see that growth.
